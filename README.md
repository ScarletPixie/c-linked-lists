# Overview

All lists have a (void *) data field. It's important to keep track of which type the void pointer has to be typecasted to to avoid data loss or undefined behavior. The reason I've decided to use void pointers is because a void pointer can hold the value of any other pointer so you can store an int * or a char * inside the nodes, as long as you know which type you're working with it's all right.
